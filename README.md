### Budget (Ideas)

- Maximum size of the images you are willing to upload to your website (before or after compression) to maintain as small page weight as possible
- Total number of HTTP requests allowed per page
- Maximum page weight totals
- Setting a threshold to achieve using Googleâ€™s Speed Index
- Limits on segmented scripts such as JavaScript, CSS, web fonts
- Total load time not to exceed a certain number (seconds or ms)
- Google fonts, local fonts, or system fonts (read our case study on web font performance)
- Number of external resources (perhaps you choose to migrate some 3rd party assets, if possible, to your own CDN)
	- Migrate Google Fonts to your CDN
	- Host Analytics Locally and on your CDN
